Hello, My Name is Sagar Desai, I am working at Prodevans as a senior Instructor. 

We have seen the Linux growth from ages and Linux is heart of all the other technologies. 

let's talk about rhel and this time it's rhel9,
 Since the birth of linux the only organization which constantly giving support to your production is none other than Redhat. 

Red Hat Enterprise Linux is undoubtedly a significant player in the open-source enterprise ecosystem.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux is market player in the open-source enterprise ecosystem.

The Red Hat business model is based on an open source ecosystem, 
where collaborative development occurs within a community of professionals focused on providing quality assurance,
 testing and customer support.

When it comes to security life cycles the major core foundation comes with RHEL9
RHEL 9.0, the latest major release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
, delivers tighter security, as well as improved installation, distribution, and management
 for enterprise server and cloud environments.

RHEL 9 includes features and enhancements to help achieve long-term IT success by using a common,
 flexible foundation to support innovation and accelerate time to market.

RHEL 9 is here with GNOME 40, which is a huge leap from the previous one as RHEL 8 supported GNOME 3.28
By default logging in as root with a password over SSH is disabled. This is a good security measure and helps prevent brute-force attacks
Live-kernel patching is now supported via the web console.  

There are numerous other features which RHEL9 serves to its customers, so why to wait? 
Install it and let yourself know :) for more details contact us at Prodevans.
